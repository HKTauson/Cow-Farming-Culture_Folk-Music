This is my NULab Seminar Project

The goal of this project is to investigate the impact that cattle farming has on American culture. In order to demonstrate this, card catalogs for different Folk songs that are about cattle and farming will be utilized. The final product should include a map of these card catalogs across the United States, to demonstrate the spread and impact of cattle farming on culture within America.
